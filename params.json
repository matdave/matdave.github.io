{"name":"matdave","tagline":"MULTIMEDIA DESIGN + DEVELOPMENT","body":"Matthew owns two dogs, which might be part of what makes him both likable and approachable. It could also explain our uncanny desire to sit and chase Frisbees whenever he's in the room. More probably it has to do with his ability to build, program, template, and troubleshoot websites faster than a speeding greyhound.\r\n\r\nGrowing up next to a wildlife preserve, and having an insatiable penchant for travel has taught Matthew to appreciate living in the moment, wherever he happens to land. Ask about memorable moments, and he'll get a faraway look in his eye as he recalls the 15-day Western European tour that gave him a firsthand look at art, architecture and historical sites. No slouch in the world of artistic talent, Matthew enjoys playing folk and rock guitar, painting, drawing, and design.\r\n\r\nMatthew holds an Associate of Applied Science in Graphic Arts degree from Central Community College (2006), where he still serves on the CCC Advisory Board. He has previous experience as a Director of Marketing and Media Production for a Midwest manufacturing company, and is on the Board of Directors of the Hastings Community Arts Council. He and his passel of pups (and three chinchillas, to boot) reside in Hastings, where he is lead developer for IdeaBank Marketing.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
